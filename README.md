## THIS IS A EXPERIMENTAL BRANCH FOR RISCV.

## [Projects](Projects)

It contains the different proyects made by me in colaboration with my patners. These proyects were inicially thought to be done on x86-xv6 but we have coded them for riscv-xv6,
due to this, some parts are made differently because of how the arquitecture works (for example, memory-wise).

The original operating system xv6 can be found on: https://github.com/mit-pdos/xv6-riscv

The expecification for this operating system on riscv is: https://pdos.csail.mit.edu/6.828/2021/xv6/book-riscv-rev2.pdf

## [Tests for the Projects](Tests)

Automatic test for the project. [See Readme](Tests/README)
These tests check some of the more important aspects of each project. They had been created by our university professor (University of Cantabria) for x86-xv6 and have been modified by us for riscv-xv6.
